# CountdownOnline

CountdownOnline is a full-stack project that recreates the British TV game show Countdown. The application features real-time multiplayer game sessions, interactive word and number rounds, and delivered through Node.js, Next.js, and Socket.io.

## Overview

CountdownOnline brings the classic game show to life by offering:
- **Live Multiplayer Sessions**: Players join a lobby and participate in game rounds in real time using Socket.io.[6]
- **Letters Round**: Contestants select a mix of vowels and consonants to form the longest word possible, echoing the original game mechanics.[2]
- **Numbers Round**: Players combine a set of numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a randomly generated target.
- **Conundrum Round**: A rapid-fire, nine-letter anagram challenge that often determines the final outcome.
- **Responsive UI & Fast Server Rendering**: Leveraging Next.js for a dynamic, lightweight front end alongside a robust Node.js backend.

## Features

- **Real-Time Interactions**: Socket.io enables smooth, bidirectional communication during gameplay.
- **Authentic Gameplay**: Game rounds follow the format of the original Countdown show.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Next.js provides a fast, SEO-friendly interface and seamless navigation.
- **Scalability**: The Node.js backend ensures quick game logic computations and can be scaled to support multiple concurrent sessions.
